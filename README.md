# IMDB_Movies Using SQL
 # Project Overview

   
**Project Title**: IMBD_Movies    
**Level**: Intermediate  
**Database**: `imdb_movies`


This project demonstrates the implementation of a IMDB_Movies Management using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

## Objectives

1. **Set up the IMDB_Movies Management Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for Actor, Box_office, Director, Genre, Rating, Movies.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **Filtering & Aggregation and Joints & Relationships.**
4. **Common Table Expressions 'CTE's', Sub Quries & Window funtions.**

## Project Structure

## Tools 
- Sql
- MySQl
## ER_Diagram
![IMDB_Movies_project](https://github.com/Sanjeev027/IMDB_Movies/blob/main/ER_Diagram.png)

## Relationships:
Movies is directed by Directors (One-to-Many: One director can direct many movies, but each movie is directed by one director).

Movies is acted by Actors (Many-to-Many: A movie can have many actors, and an actor can act in many movies).

Movies belongs to Genres (Many-to-Many: A movie can belong to multiple genres, and a genre can have multiple movies).

Movies has Ratings (One-to-One: Each movie has one rating, and each rating belongs to one movie).

Movies has Financials (One-to-One: Each movie has one financial record, and each financial record belongs to one movie).

## Project Structure :

 - **Database Creation** : Created a database named `Movies_db`.
 - **Table Creation** : Created tables for Movies, , Directors, Genre, Actors, Rating, and Financials status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

 ```sql
#Create DataBase.
create database IMDB_Movies;

#Use Datbase.
use IMDB_Movies;

#Show Tables from using DataBase.
show tables;

CREATE TABLE Movies (
    MovieID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ReleaseYear INT,
    Runtime INT,
    Overview TEXT,
    Certificate VARCHAR(10)
);
CREATE TABLE Directors (
    DirectorID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE Genres (
    GenreID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    GenreName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE Actors (
    ActorID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE Ratings (
    RatingID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    MovieID INT,
    IMDB_Rating DECIMAL(3,1),
    MetaScore INT,
    No_of_Votes INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (MovieID) REFERENCES Movies(MovieID)
);
CREATE TABLE Financials (
    FinancialID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    MovieID INT,
    Gross BIGINT,
    FOREIGN KEY (MovieID) REFERENCES Movies(MovieID)
);

```

### 2.CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the tables.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `movies` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `genre` table as needed.

**1. Insert data into Created Tables.**

**For UPDATE & DELETE OPERATIONS.**
- Using My_sql to write an command for using the commands like update & Delete.
- 0 for safe mode off, 1 for safe mode on.
```sql 
set sql_safe_updates = 0;
```

**2 : Update an Existing Record From Movies Table.**

```sql
update movies 
set Title = 'The Matrix Part - 1'
where movieID = 10;
```

**3 : Delete a Record From Genre Table.**
```sql
delete from genres
where Genrename = 'comedy';
```

## üìù Basic Queries.

**1. Retrieve all movie titles and their release years.**

```sql 
select title,ReleaseYear from movies;
 ```
**2.Find all movies that were released after the year 2000.**

```sql
select * from movies
where ReleaseYear > 2000;
```

**3.List all directors in alphabetical order.**
```sql
select * from directors
order by name asc;
```
**4.Show the top 10 movies with the highest IMDb rating.**
``` sql
select m.title,r.IMDB_Rating from ratings r
join movies m
where m.MovieID = r.MovieID
order by IMDB_Rating desc 
limit 10;
```

**5.Find movies with a runtime greater than 150 minutes.**
```sql

```

## üîç Filtering and Aggregation.

**6.List movies that have a certificate of "A" (Adult).**
```sql

```
**9.Find the highest-grossing movie.**
```sql
select f.Gross,m.Title from financials f
join movies m
where m.movieid = f. movieid
order by Gross desc
limit 1;
```

## üîó Joins & Relationships.


**10.Find all movies directed by "Christopher Nolan.**
```sql
select m.Title,d.name from movies m
join directors d
on m.MovieID = d.DirectorID
where d.name = 'Christopher Nolan'; 
```
**11.Retrieve movies along with their IMDb rating.**
```sql
select m.Title,r.imdb_rating from movies m
join ratings r
on r.movieid = m.MovieID;
```
**12.Get the total box office earnings for each movie.**
```sql
select f.Gross,m.Title from movies m
join financials f
on f.MovieID = m.MovieID
order by gross desc;
```
**13.Find the movie with the most votes.**
```sql
select r.No_of_Votes,m.Title from ratings r
join movies m
on r.MovieID=m.MovieID
order by No_of_Votes desc;
```
**14.Find the average IMDB rating of all movies in the dataset.**
```sql
select avg(IMDB_Rating) from ratings;
```
**15.Calculate the total box office gross of all movies combined from the Financials dataset.**
```sql
SELECT SUM(Gross) AS Total_Box_Office_Gross 
FROM Financials;
```
##  Window Functions().
**16.Rank movies based on their IMDB rating, partitioned by their release year.**

```sql
select m.title,m.releaseyear,r.imdb_rating,
rank() over (partition by m.releaseyear order by r.imdb_rating desc ) as rank_
from ratings r
join movies m 
on m.movieid = r.movieid;
```
**17.Find the cumulative total gross earnings of movies in descending order of release year.**
```sql
SELECT 
    m.title, 
    m.releaseyear, 
    f.gross, 
    SUM(f.gross) OVER (ORDER BY m.releaseyear DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cumulative_gross
FROM movies m
JOIN financials f ON m.movieid = f.movieid
ORDER BY m.releaseyear DESC;
```
**18.Show each movie‚Äôs IMDB rating along with the difference between its rating and the average rating across all movies.**
 ```sql
SELECT 
    M.Title, 
    R.IMDB_Rating, 
    R.IMDB_Rating - AVG(R.IMDB_Rating) OVER () AS Rating_Difference
FROM Movies M
JOIN Ratings R ON M.MovieID = R.MovieID;
```
## CTE's & Subquries.
**19.Find the top 3 highest-grossing movies
 Use a CTE to first rank movies based on their total gross earnings, then filter the top 3.**
```sql
WITH RankedMovies AS (
    SELECT 
        m.title, 
        f.gross,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY f.gross DESC) AS rank_
    FROM movies m
    JOIN financials f ON m.movieid = f.movieid
)
SELECT title, gross, rank_
FROM RankedMovies
WHERE rank_ <= 3;
```
**20.List movies with a higher IMDB rating than the average rating
Use a CTE to calculate the average IMDB rating, then select movies with ratings above this value.**
```sql
WITH AvgRating AS (
    SELECT AVG(imdb_rating) AS avg_rating FROM ratings
)
SELECT 
    m.title, 
    r.imdb_rating
FROM movies m
JOIN ratings r ON m.movieid = r.movieid
CROSS JOIN AvgRating
WHERE r.imdb_rating > AvgRating.avg_rating;
```

**Subquries**
**21.Find the movie with the highest IMDB rating.**
**without subquery.**
```sql
select * from ratings
order by IMDB_Rating desc
limit 1;
```
**with subquery.**
```sql
select * from ratings
where imdb_rating = (select max(imdb_rating) from ratings);
```
**22.Retrieve the names of movies with an IMDB rating higher than the average rating of all movies.**
```sql
select m.title,r.imdb_rating from movies m 
left join ratings r on r.movieid = m.movieid
where r.imdb_rating > (select avg(imdb_rating) from ratings);
```
**23.List movies that made more revenue than the average gross earnings of all movies.**
```sql
select m.title,f.gross from movies m 
join financials f on m.movieid = f.movieid
where f.gross > (select avg(gross) from financials);
```
